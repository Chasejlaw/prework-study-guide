          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. 
            Whereas HTML strictly handles the structure and content of a webpage, CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. 
            We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.
          </li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.
          </li>
          <li>Separation of Concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. It is one of the key design principles that we practice in the boot camp. Separation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.
