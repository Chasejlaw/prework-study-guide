      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> gives the content structure.</li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>Headings are exactly what they sound like: larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page</li>
        <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag. These tags are most often represented by angle brackets with associated tag names contained inside</li>
      </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS):</b> is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. 
            Whereas HTML strictly handles the structure and content of a webpage, CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. 
            We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Separation of Concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. It is one of the key design principles that we practice in the boot camp. Separation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document. A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
          <li>The padding property is often confused with margin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a free, open source version control system that allows web developers to collaborate on projects without overwriting each other's work. It also allows developers to revert to previous versions of the code if a problem is discovered.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li><b>Committing files and pushing Branches:</b></li>
            git add -A <br>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal</li>
          <li>At the most basic level, a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
          <li>To declare a variable in JavaScript, we have a few different options. Prior to more recent changes to JavaScript, we used the var keyword to create a variable in our code. You may see var from time to time, and it's a valid part of JavaScript, but it's important to note that all modern JavaScript uses new syntax, so we should avoid using var.</li>
          <li>The first variable keyword we might use is const. The const keyword allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned a value. It essentially "locks down" what that variable will be, and once we declare it, we can never reassign it. When writing JavaScript, we always want to start by declaring variables using const. The second variable keyword we might use is let</li>
