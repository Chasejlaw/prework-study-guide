To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review my notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, you can open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). Then, a console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics that I learned from the prework, along with a suggestion on which topic you can study first.
